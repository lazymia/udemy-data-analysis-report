# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Udemy is seeking to discover ways to increase its next quarterly earnings on Udemy's most popular courses having discovered that Web Development is the most popular amongst all four courses uploaded on the platform.

The Udemy team is looking to encourage Web development to charge more as it appears that they are the most patronized with a teeming number of subscribers as against other courses listed on the Udemy platform.

# DESIGN
The [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EqZYoL9WCgItrLWvGzt1fK5iYf5BFMrGrqtIFyD_GD4/edit?gid=2052612546#gid=2052612546) collected was gotten from multiple sources and was merged in one excel sheet. To clean the data and make it ready for analysis, duplicates were removed, and names adjusted for uniformity across the dataset.

Excel formulas such as the **IF FUNCTION**   and the **VLOOKUPS** were applied to ascertain the paid/free courses, and to also filter the courses that were free and beginner courses.

Tableau was used as the visualization tool to display relevant information pertaining to the dataset. This also helped to draw conclusions and recommend possible solutions regarding the problem.

# FINDINGS
- The following are the findings from the analysis from a sample size of 20 most subscribed courses on the Udemy learning platform.
- The most subscribed course was a free course
- Most beginner would prefer to subscribe to a free course than a paid course
- It was found that 75% of the top 20 courses was a Web Development course; that is more people are interested in web development than they are in other courses
- 30% of the 75% who have the web development course paid for it, leaving the 45% buying the course for free
- The lowest in sales was the business finance course
- No subscriber paid for the business finance course across all the four levels. Not many people are interested in the business finance course, let alone paying for it.

# ANALYSIS
Analysis was carried out using **Pivot Charts** and **Tableau** for visualization.

**Sum of Subscribers**
The image below shows the sum of the total number of subscribers for each of the subjects from the dataset with a sample size of 20.
