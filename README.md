# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Udemy is seeking to discover ways to increase its next quarterly earnings on Udemy's most popular courses having discovered that Web Development is the most popular amongst all four courses uploaded on the platform.

The Udemy team is looking to encourage Web development to charge more as it appears that they are the most patronized with a teeming number of subscribers as against other courses listed on the Udemy platform.

# DESIGN
The [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EqZYoL9WCgItrLWvGzt1fK5iYf5BFMrGrqtIFyD_GD4/edit?gid=2052612546#gid=2052612546) collected was gotten from multiple sources and was merged in one excel sheet. To clean the data and make it ready for analysis, duplicates were removed, and names adjusted for uniformity across the dataset.

Excel formulas such as the **IF FUNCTION**   and the **VLOOKUPS** were applied to ascertain the paid/free courses, and to also filter the courses that were free and beginner courses.

Tableau was used as the visualization tool to display relevant information pertaining to the dataset. This also helped to draw conclusions and recommend possible solutions regarding the problem.

# FINDINGS
- The following are the findings from the analysis from a sample size of 20 most subscribed courses on the Udemy learning platform.
- The most subscribed course was a free course
- Most beginner would prefer to subscribe to a free course than a paid course
- It was found that 75% of the top 20 courses was a Web Development course; that is more people are interested in web development than they are in other courses
- 30% of the 75% who have the web development course paid for it, leaving the 45% buying the course for free
- The lowest in sales was the business finance course
- No subscriber paid for the business finance course across all the four levels. Not many people are interested in the business finance course, let alone paying for it.

# ANALYSIS
Analysis was carried out using **Pivot Charts** and **Tableau** for visualization.

# CONCLUSION
From the analysis carried out on the Udemy platform across four courses ( web development, graphics and design, music and business finance), a sample size of top 20 subscribers was collected for the analysis, thereby kicking graphic design off the leaderboard.

Excel spreadsheet was used to collect and merge the dataset from different sources, used for calculation and formula derivation required for the analysis. Pivot table was used to display the outcome of the excel table.

Results showed that web development has the highest number of subscribers with 67.9%, followed by business finance with 15.9%, graphic design 9.0%, and musical instrument 7.2%.

With the percentage rate shown above, musical instruments did not make it to the top 20 subscribers when the descending formula was used to filter the dataset.

Tableau was used as a visualization tool. It showed the numbers spread across the dataset and gave a visual view of how the data was represented.

Analysing the total numbers on each level of the subjects, web development had the highest number of subscribers in the four sections of the levels ( All levels, beginner level, expert level and intermediate level). This means that web development can be referred to as the oil well for the Udemy platform as many people show more interest in it than in other subjects.

When the free and paid courses were analysed, web development had the highest number of both paid and free courses beating the others by a mile.

In conclusion, more attention should be paid to web development and more courses added to its curriculum, more paid courses should be introduced as well, as this has proven without an iota of doubt to be the goldmine that will increase Udemy's quarterly sales in the coming year.
